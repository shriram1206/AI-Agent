## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment**

### **Issue: Build Fails**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if vercel.json is correct
# Verify requirements.txt exists
# Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
```

### **Issue: Environment Variables Not Working**
**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure variables are added for "Production"
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### **Issue: 500 Internal Server Error**
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel logs: Project → Deployments → [latest] → Runtime Logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check for database connection issues

### **Issue: Database Errors**
**Solution:**
- SQLite won't work on Vercel (serverless)
- Options:
  1. Use Vercel Postgres (easiest)
  2. Use Supabase (free)
  3. Use PlanetScale (free MySQL)

---

## 💾 **Database Setup for Vercel**

Since SQLite doesn't work on serverless:

### **Option 1: Vercel Postgres (Recommended)**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard
Storage → Create Database → PostgreSQL
# Copy DATABASE_URL
# Add to environment variables
```

### **Option 2: Supabase (Free)**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Create project
3. Get connection string from Settings → Database
4. Add to Vercel env vars:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   ```

### **Option 3: Start Fresh (Simplest)**
- Vercel will create SQLite in /tmp (temporary)
- Users/conversations reset on each deploy
- Good for testing, not production

---

## 📝 **Your New URLs**

After Vercel deployment, you'll get:

### **Primary URL:**
```
https://ai-agent-[random].vercel.app
or
https://thomas-ai-[random].vercel.app
```

### **To Get Custom Domain:**
1. Vercel Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for SSL certificate (2-3 minutes)

## 🎯 **Next Steps - Priority Order**

1. **✅ DONE:** Deleted Render service
2. **→ NOW:** Deploy to Vercel (follow steps above)
3. **→ THEN:** Test all features thoroughly
4. **→ FINALLY:** Set up database (if needed)
