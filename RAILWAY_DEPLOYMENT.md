## 🔄 Alternative: Keep Trying Vercel?

If you really want Vercel to work, we need to:
1. Completely restructure the app for serverless
2. Remove Flask-SQLAlchemy (doesn't work serverless)
3. Use external database (Supabase/PlanetScale)
4. Rewrite all routes as individual functions

**This takes hours and is complicated.**

Railway works in 2 minutes with your current code! 🚂

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://railway.app/
